title: Practice Final
--- 

The final exam will be a closed-book paper exam without a calculator.
Exam questions will be similar in type to those found here, but
fewer in number. While this practice exam is a good study guide, we
highly recommend being familiar with _all the material_ (including but not limited to your previous exams, labs, projects, quizzes and homework) as well.

# Problem 0 (Warm-up)

#. What is the escape sequence for a new line?
#. What is the return type of a constructor?
#. List 4 datatypes.
#. What is the difference between a variable and a constant?
#. In an exam class, if I want to keep track of the total number of exams should the attribute be static or non-static?
#. Write a condition that evaluates to true if an int length is between 4 and 16, both inclusive.
#. Write a statement or statements that creates an int array of size 50 with each index containing that index as its value. (i.e. 0 at `[0]`, 13 at `[13]`, 49 at `[49]`, etc.).
#. Write a statement or statements to create a random number generator called `examRand` and use it to generate a random number between 40 and 57 (inclusive).


# Problem 1

Consider the code below:

```
class VirtualPet{
    private string name = "Blank";          // Name of the pet.
    private decimal hungerLevel = 1m;       // Level of hunger, with 1 being full, in percent.
    private decimal happinessLevel = 1m;    // Level of happiness, in percent

    public void SetName(string nameP)
    {
        name = nameP;
    }
}
```

#. Write a statement to instantiate a `VirtualPet` object called `firstPet`.

#. Write a getter for the name attribute.
  
#. Write a setter for the `hungerLevel` attribute that takes one decimal. The argument should be assigned to the `hungerLevel` attribute only if it is between 0 and 1 (both included), otherwise the attribute should get the value 0.

#. Draw the UML diagram for the `VirtualPet` class, including the methods you just added.

#. Write a constructor that takes 3 arguments (`string`, `decimal`, `decimal`) for the `VirtualPet` class. Your constructor should be such that if one of the decimal arguments is not between 0 and 1 (both included), then 0 gets assigned to both decimal attributes.

#. Your earlier statement that created the firstPet object will no longer compile after you add the constructor. Why is this the case?
  
#. Write a `ToString` method for the `VirtualPet` class. It should display the name, `hungerLevel`, and `happinessLevel`.
(Bonus) Display `hungerLevel` and `happinessLevel` graphically: for instance, if `hungerLevel` is at 4.5, display "Hunger: XXXX". You may freely use symbols as if they were normal letters.
  
#. Write a statement that would use the `ToString` method from the `VirtualPet` class you just added to display information about the `secondPet` object.

# Problem 2

This question will have you partially design, implement and use class to represent hamburgers. A Burger has a name, a price, a Boolean for dairy, and a type (typically beef, pork, chicken, veggie).

#. Draw the UML diagram for the Burger class, assuming it contains the listed attributes, a getter for the name attribute and a setter for the price attribute. Do not include any other methods.

#. Write a setter for the price attribute.
    
#. Write an additional constructor that takes a name, a dairy, and a type. The price should then be set according to the following table. If the value for type is not in the table, price should be set to -99.99.

#. Write a static method Promotion that takes as an argument a price and returns a value 75% of the argument.
  
#. Write a `ToString` method. The string returned should contain the values of all attributes.

# Problem 3

Complete the table based on the code.

if(x<0 && y == 'a'){
  Console.Write("1");

  Console.Write("2");

  Console.Write("3");

  Console.Write("5");
}
```


# Problem 4

Given two int arrays of equal length, write a code segment that compares the values at each index to see if they match. Return the total number of matches.


# Problem 5 (Deceptively hard)

Given two string arrays (array A and array B) of unknown (possibly different) lengths, determine if there are any values found in both A and B. If they exist, display them to the screen. At the end of the program, display the total number of common values between A and B. If there are repeating values in either or both arrays, each should only be counted once.


(Bonus): How could Lists be used to make this problem easier?


# Problem 6

Write a program that declares an int variable called "pin" and asks the user for their pin. As long as the user enters something that is not a number, is negative, or greater than 9999, your program should ask again. 

(Bonus): Your code should make sure that the pin has exactly 4 digits, including leading zeros.


# Problem 7

#. Write a statement that would create an int array of size 100.
  
#.  Write a series of statements that would ask the user to enter a value for each cell in the array (no need to perform user-input validation, but you may if you like).
#. Write a series of statements that would ask the user to enter a value, displaying "In your array" if the value is in your array.
#. Write a series of statements that would display the sum of values in the array.
#. Write a series of statements that would display the product of all the non-zero values in the array.
#. Write a series of statements that would display the smallest index of the greatest value in the array.
