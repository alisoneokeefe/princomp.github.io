## Problems

#. Find 3 syntax errors in this short C# code.
```cs
int num11 =1;
int num2 ==2;
if num11>-num2) {Console.WriteLine(“Yes”);}
else {Console.WriteLie(“No”);} 
```
<details><summary>Solution</summary>
  
  int num11 =1;
  
  int num2 ==2;   // == comparison operator cannot be used with variable declaration
  
  if num11>-num2) {Console.WriteLine(“Yes”);}   // if condition missing open parenthesis
  
  else {Console.WriteLie(“No”);}   // WriteLie is not a method in the Console class, whereas WriteLine is.
