else {Console.WriteLie(“No”);} 
```
<details><summary>Solution</summary>
  
  int num11 =1;
  
  int num2 ==2;   // == comparison operator cannot be used with variable declaration
  
  if num11>-num2) {Console.WriteLine(“Yes”);}   // if condition missing open parenthesis
  
  else {Console.WriteLie(“No”);}   // WriteLie is not a method in the Console class, whereas WriteLine is.
  
</details>

        {
            A[2] += A[2];
            B /= B;
        }
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            int[] A = { 0, 1, 2, 3 };
            S(A, A[2]);
            Console.Write($"[{A[0]},{A[1]},{A[2]},{A[3]}]");
        }
    }
    ```
    <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>

		Console.Write("Scene " + y + ", take " + z + ". " );
	Console.WriteLine();
}
```
