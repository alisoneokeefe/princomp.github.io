title: Practice Final (with solutions)
--- 

The final exam will be a closed-book paper exam without a calculator.
Exam questions will be similar in type to those found here, but
fewer in number. While this practice exam is a good study guide, we
highly recommend being familiar with _all the material_ (including but not limited to your previous exams, labs, projects, quizzes and homework) as well.

# Problem 0 (Warm-up)

#. Write a statement or statements that creates an int array of size 50 with each index containing that index as its value. (i.e. 0 at `[0]`, 13 at `[13]`, 49 at `[49]`, etc.).
<details><summary>Solution</summary>```
int[] numbers = new int[50];
for(int i= 0; i<numbers.Length;i++)
{
  numbers[i]=i; 
}
```
</details>
#. Write a statement or statements to create a random number generator called `examRand` and use it to generate a random number between 40 and 57 (inclusive).
<details><summary>Solution</summary>```
Random examRand = new Random();
examRand.Next(40,58);
```

# Problem 1

Consider the code below:

```
class VirtualPet{
    private string name = "Blank";          // Name of the pet.
    private decimal hungerLevel = 1m;       // Level of hunger, with 1 being full, in percent.
    private decimal happinessLevel = 1m;    // Level of happiness, in percent

    public void SetName(string nameP)
    {
        name = nameP;
    }
}
```

#. Write a statement to instantiate a `VirtualPet` object called `firstPet`.
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
    VirtualPet firstPet = new VirtualPet();
    ```  
    Review classes and objects if you cannot do this. It should be straightforward.
    </details>

#. Write a getter for the name attribute.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Review classes and objects if you cannot do this. It should be straightforward.</details>
  
#. Write a statement that would display to the screen the name of the `firstPet` object you created previously. What would be displayed?
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Make sure you call the `GetName` method. It should return the default name from our `VirtualPet` class (what is that?).</details>
  
#. Write a setter for the `hungerLevel` attribute that takes one decimal. The argument should be assigned to the `hungerLevel` attribute only if it is between 0 and 1 (both included), otherwise the attribute should get the value 0.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
    public void SetHunger(decimal level)
    {
      hungerLevel=(level>=0m && level<=1m)?level:0m;
    }
  ``` 
  Note that while we use the conditional operator here, you can replace that with an `if-else`.
  </details>

#. Draw the UML diagram for the `VirtualPet` class, including the methods you just added.
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>```text

    |=====================================================|

    ```
    </details>

#. Write a constructor that takes 3 arguments (`string`, `decimal`, `decimal`) for the `VirtualPet` class. Your constructor should be such that if one of the decimal arguments is not between 0 and 1 (both included), then 0 gets assigned to both decimal attributes.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
  public VirtualPet(string nameP, decimal hunger, decimal happy)
  {
    name = nameP;
    if(hunger>=0m && hunger<=1m && happy>=0m && happy<=1m){
      hungerLevel=hunger;
      happinessLevel=happy;
    }
    else{
      hungerLevel=0m;
      happinessLevel=0m;
    }
  }
  ```
  </details>

#. Your earlier statement that created the firstPet object will no longer compile after you add the constructor. Why is this the case?
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Because the default constructor was replaced with the new constructor. Since you are providing your own constructor, C# doesn't provide the default, no-args constructor anymore.</details>

#. Write a statement that would create a new `VirtualPet` object called `secondPet` using the constructor you just added (the argument values are up to you).
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
    VirtualPet secondPet = new VirtualPet("Rover", 0.8m, 0.5m);
  </details>
  
#. Write a `ToString` method for the `VirtualPet` class. It should display the name, `hungerLevel`, and `happinessLevel`.
(Bonus) Display `hungerLevel` and `happinessLevel` graphically: for instance, if `hungerLevel` is at 4.5, display "Hunger: XXXX". You may freely use symbols as if they were normal letters.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
  public override string ToString(){
    string returnable= "Name: "+name+ ", Hunger: ";
    for(int i=10; i>0; i--){
      returnable+=(i>(hungerLevel10))? "" : "X";
    }
    returnable+= ", Happiness: ";
    for(int j=10; j>0; j--){
      returnable+=(j>(happinessLevel10))? "" : "X";
    }
    return returnable;
  }
  ```
  Note that while we use the conditional operator here, you can replace that with an `if-else`.
  </details>
  
#. Write a statement that would use the `ToString` method from the `VirtualPet` class you just added to display information about the `secondPet` object.
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
    Console.WriteLine(secondPet);
    ```  
    This statement will _implicitely_ calls the `ToString` method. It is actually equivalent to `Console.WriteLine(secondPet.ToString());`.
    </details>

# Problem 2

This question will have you partially design, implement and use class to represent hamburgers. A Burger has a name, a price, a Boolean for dairy, and a type (typically beef, pork, chicken, veggie).

#. Draw the UML diagram for the Burger class, assuming it contains the listed attributes, a getter for the name attribute and a setter for the price attribute. Do not include any other methods.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Assume name is string, price is decimal, and type is string. Otherwise look at the UML from question 1 for an example.</details>

#. Write a getter for the name attribute.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Review classes and objects if you cannot do this. It should be straightforward.</details>

#. Write a setter for the price attribute.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Review classes and objects if you cannot do this. It should be straightforward.</details>

#. Write a constructor that takes 4 arguments and sets the value of the attributes to be the value of the arguments.

      type=typeP;
    }
    ```</details>
    
#. Write an additional constructor that takes a name, a dairy, and a type. The price should then be set according to the following table. If the value for type is not in the table, price should be set to -99.99.

  </details>
  
#. Write a `ToString` method. The string returned should contain the values of all attributes.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>Easier version of `ToString` from Problem 1. Remember to use keyword override.</details>

#. Write a statement/statements that:

  - Displays the result of passing 12.84 to Promotion.
  - Instantiates a Burger object named OldBeefy with the values "Old Beefy", 1.99, true, and "beef".
  - Changes the price of OldBeefy to 2.29.
  - Displays the name (and only the name) of OldBeefy.
  - Store the value returned by calling the ToString method with OldBeefy in a variable.
    <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
    // Displays the result of passing 12.84 to Promotion.
    Console.WriteLine(Burger.Promotion (12.84m));
    // The answer is 9.63m

    // Instantiates a Burger object named OldBeefy with the values "Old Beefy", 1.99, true, and "beef".
    Burger OldBeefy = new Burger("Old Beefy", 1.99m, true, "beef");

    // Changes the price of OldBeefy to 2.29.

# Problem 4

Given two int arrays of equal length, write a code segment that compares the values at each index to see if they match. Return the total number of matches.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>```
//given int [] A and int [] B of some length
int matches=0;
for (int i=0; i<A.Length; i++)
{
  matches+=(A[i]==B[i])?1:0;
}
Console.WriteLine(matches);

//Note that while I use the conditional operator here, you can replace that with an if-else

//if version:
int matches=0;
for (int i=0; i<A.Length; i++)
{
  if (A[i]==B[i])
  matches++;
}
Console.WriteLine(matches);
```
</details>

# Problem 5 (Deceptively hard)

Given two string arrays (array A and array B) of unknown (possibly different) lengths, determine if there are any values found in both A and B. If they exist, display them to the screen. At the end of the program, display the total number of common values between A and B. If there are repeating values in either or both arrays, each should only be counted once.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```
string[] C = new string[A.Length];
string temp="";
bool inC=false, inD=false;
int firstBlankC=0, firstBlankD=0, total=0;

for(int i=0;i<A.Length;i++){
  inC=false;
  for(int j=0;j<C.Length;j++){
    if(A[i]==C[j]){
      inC=true;
      break;//ends the inner for loop early
    }
    if(!inC){//same depth as the inner for loop
    {
      C[firstBlankC]=A[i];
      firstBlankC++;
  }
}//close outer for

//Repeat that code, but replace A with B and C with D. That gets rid
of the duplicates.

for(int i=0;i<firstBlankC;i++){
  for(int j=0;j<firstBlankD;j++){
    if(C[i]==D[j]){
      Console.WriteLine(C[i]);
      total++;
    }
  }
}
Console.Writeline($"Total values in common: {total}.");
```
</details>

(Bonus): How could Lists be used to make this problem easier?

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```
//Assuming A and B are lists instead of arrays; you can also just make
new Lists from the arrays
//with the .AddRange() method of the List class

int total=0;
while(A.Count>0){
if(B.Contains(A[0])){
Console.WriteLine(A[0]);
total++;
}
B.RemoveAll(item => item==A[0]);
A.RemoveAll(item => item==A[0]);
}
Console.WriteLine($"The total number of matches is {total}");
```
</details>

# Problem 6

Write a program that declares an int variable called "pin" and asks the user for their pin. As long as the user enters something that is not a number, is negative, or greater than 9999, your program should ask again. 

(Bonus): Your code should make sure that the pin has exactly 4 digits, including leading zeros.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
```
string userInput = "";
int pin = 0, numDigits = 0;
bool valid = false;
do {
  Console.WriteLine("Please enter your 4-digit pin.");
  userInput = Console.ReadLine();
  valid = int.TryParse(userInput, pin);
  if (valid) {
    valid = (userInput.Length == 4);
  }
} while (!valid || pin < 0 || pin > 9999);
Console.WriteLine("Pin successfully set!");
```

  </details>
#. Write a series of statements that would display the sum of values in the array.
  <details><summary>Solution</summary>```
  int sum=0;
