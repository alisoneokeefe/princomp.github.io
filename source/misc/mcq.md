#. Why are the instructors sharing most of the material in odt, docx, pdf, html and md?

    - [ ] To insure compatibility across operating systems (Android, Linux, Windows, MacOs, …).
    - [ ] To make it easier to access the resources in multiple ways (print, screen, etc.)
    - [ ] All of the above.

#. What does "free" software means?

    - [ ] That the software has no value.
    - [ ] That the users can run the software for any purpose and study its source code.
    - [ ] That it is not developed by a company.
    - [ ] That the software can be downloaded at no cost.

#. In your IDE, the shortcut to compile your program is usually…

    - [ ] "Build your solution", ctrl + shift + B or Cmd + B
    - [ ] "Save", ctrl + S or Cmd + S
    - [ ] "Exit", alt + F4 or Cmd + q
    - [ ] "Start without debugging", Ctrl + F5 or Cmd + F5

#. To share or backup a project, you need to…

    - [ ] share the .sln file.
    - [ ] share the .cs file.
    - [ ] share the .csproj file.
    - [ ] zip the folder containing the .sln file and another folder with multiple files and folders in it.

#. If your IDE returns the message
    
    ```text
    Program.cs(21,21): Error CS0117: 'Console' does not contain a definition for 'WiteLine' (CS0117) (Solution)
    ```
    
    This means that…
    
    - [ ] That you misspelled the word "WriteLine".
    - [ ] Your program successfully compiled and is ready to be executed.
    - [ ] That the "Console" class does not exist.
    - [ ] Your IDE was not properly installed and you should reboot your computer.

#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    int age, defaultChoice = 0;
    decimal averagePrice;
    ```
    
    Which of the following is correct?
    
    - [ ] It contains declaration and initialization statements.
    - [ ] It declares variables of two different datatypes.
    - [ ] Only the value of `defaultChoice` is set.
    - [ ] All of the above.
    
#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    int person = 12;
    int pie = 5;
    int piePerPerson = pie / person;
    Console.WriteLine("Each guest gets " + piePerPerson + " pie(s).");
    ```
    
    What will be displayed by it?
    
    - [ ] Nothing: an error will prevent from compiling it successfully.
    - [ ] "Each guest gets 2.4 pie(s)."
    - [ ] "Each guest gets 0.41666666666666666666666..." (it will never ends, displaying 6 forever).
    - [ ] "Each guest gets 0.416666666666667 pie(s)."
    - [ ] "Each guest gets 0 pie(s)."

#. Consider the following statement:

    ```
    decimal balance = 2.5M;
    decimal price = 12;
    decimal remainingBalance = balance - price;
    ```
    
    Which of the following is correct?
    
    - [ ] This program will not compile because the result of `balance - price` is not a decimal.
    - [ ] This program will not compile because a decimal cannot be negative.
    - [ ] This program will compile.
    - [ ] This program will not compile because you cannot store an integer value (12) in a decimal.

#. The method used to read a string from the user is called...

    - [ ] `ReadString`
    - [ ] `ReadFrom`
    - [ ] `ReadLine`
    - [ ] `ReadInput`
    
#. Consider the following program:

    ```
    Console.WriteLine("Enter your age.");
    string fromUser = Console.ReadLine();
    int age = _______ (fromUser);
    ```
    
    To correctly be able to store the string in `fromUser` into age, you should replace `_______` with...
    
    - [ ] `(int)`
    - [ ] `int.Parse`
    - [ ] Nothing: as long as the user enters an integer value, we can store it into age just fine.
    - [ ] None of the above.
    
#. What are, respectively, the return types of a constructor and of a `ToString` method?

    - [ ] Constructors do not have a return type, and a `ToString` method returns a `string`.
    - [ ] Constructors and `ToString` methods both return `string`s.
    - [ ] Constructors returns a `string`, and a `ToString` method does not return anything (it simply displays a text).
    - [ ] It is impossible to know ahead of time, as this depends of the class they are implemented in.
    
#. What is the name of a constructor method?

    - [ ] Nothing: an error will prevent from compiling it successfully.
    - [ ] Whatever the name of the class is.
    - [ ] It does not have any.
    - [ ] The name of the instance it creates.
    - [ ] `Constructor`
    
#. What are the three logical connectives in C# (that we studied)?

    - [ ] And (`&&`), or (`||`) and negation (`!`).
    - [ ] Equality (`==`), greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`).
    - [ ] And (`and`), or (`or`) and negation (`not`).
    
#. Which of the following will evaluate to true?

    - [ ] `3 > 1 && 2`
    - [ ] `(3 > 1) && 1 != 0`
    - [ ] `!(3 > 1)`
    - [ ] `3 > 1 || 2`
    
#. Will the following expression evaluates, and if so, what will it evaluate to?

    ```
    true == false || 2 / 1 > 0 && 3 - 1 != 2 * 0.5 + 0.5
    ```
    
    evaluates?
    
    - [ ] It will evaluate to a number.
    - [ ] It will evaluate to `false`.
    - [ ] It will evaluate to `true`.
    - [ ] It will not evaluate.
    - [ ] None of the above.

#. What will be displayed by the following code?

    ```
    int number = 10;
    while (number <= 15)
    {
        number+=2;
        Console.Write(number + " ");
    }
    ```
    
    - [ ] `12 14 16`
    - [ ] `10 11 12 13 14 15`
    - [ ] `10 11 12 13 14`
    - [ ] `10 12 16`
    - [ ] `10 12`
    - [ ] `10 12 14`
    - [ ] `12+14+16`
    - [ ] `10+11+12+13+14+15`

#. What will be displayed by the following code?

    ```
    int i = 0;
    while(i < 10)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
    }
    ```
    
    - [ ] `0` followed by a new line, forever.
    - [ ] `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`
    - [ ] `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9` with a new line between each number
    - [ ] Nothing
    
#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    Console.WriteLine("Enter… something!");
    int answer;
    bool valid = int.TryParse(Console.ReadLine(), out answer);
    Console.WriteLine($"returns: {valid}, value:{answer}");
    ```
    
    If the user enters "Train", then it will display:
    
    - [ ] returns: False, value: 0
    - [ ] returns: True, value: 0
    - [ ] returns: True, value: Train
    - [ ] returns: False, value: Train
    - [ ] Nothing: the program will crash.
    
#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    string answer;
    Console.WriteLine("Enter something");
    answer = Console.ReadLine();
    while (answer != "yes" || answer !="Yes"){
        Console.WriteLine("Enter something");
        answer = Console.ReadLine();
    }
    ```

    What can the user enters to _exit_ this loop:
    
    - [ ] There is nothing the user can enter to exit this loop
    - [ ] Either "Yes" or "yes"
    - [ ] Anything that is different from "Yes" and "yes"
    - [ ] Anything
    
#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    int answer;
    Console.WriteLine("Enter something");
    answer = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    while (answer > 10 && answer < 100){
        Console.WriteLine("Enter something");
        answer = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    }
    ```
    
    What can the user enters to _exit_ this loop?
    
    - [ ] Any number not between 10 and 100 (both included)
    - [ ] Any number between 10 and 100 (both included)
    - [ ] Any number between 10 and 100 (both excluded)
    - [ ] Any number not between 10 and 100 (both excluded)

#. What is the correct way of creating an array of `int` of size 5 named `myArray`?

    - [ ] `int[] myArray = new int[5];`
    - [ ] `int[] myArray = int[5];`
    - [ ] `int[5] myArray = new int[];`
    - [ ] `int[4] myArray = new int[];`
    - [ ] `int myArray = new int[5];`
    - [ ] `int[] myArray = new int[4];`
    - [ ] `int[] myArray = new int(5);`
    - [ ] `int[] myArray = int[4];`
    
#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    int[] grades = {10, 20, 5, 15};
    Console.WriteLine(grades[2]);
    ```

    What will it display?
    
    - [ ] 5
    - [ ] Nothing
    - [ ] 20
    - [ ] 15
    - [ ] grades
    - [ ] grades[2]
    - [ ] 10

#. Consider the following code:

    ```
    char[] grades = {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'};
    int i = 0;
    while(i < grades.Length){
        i++;
        Console.WriteLine(grades[i]);
    }
    ```

    Something is wrong with it, can you tell what?
    
    - [ ] There will be an "Index was outside the bounds of the array." error.
    - [ ] The array is not properly initialized.
    - [ ] The loop is infinite
    - [ ] `grades.Length` is not declared.
    
#. What will be displayed by the following code?

    ```
    for (int e = -5; e <= 20; e += 5)
    {
        Console.Write(e + " ");
    }
    ```
    
    - [ ] -5 0 5 10 15 20 
    - [ ] -5 0 5 10 15
    - [ ] 0 5 10 15
    - [ ] -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
    - [ ] Nothing
    - [ ] 0 5 10 15 20

#. What will be displayed by the following code?

    ```
    int variable = 0;
    for (int e = 1; e <= 5; e += 1)
    {
        variable += e;
    }    
    Console.WriteLine(variable);
    ```
    
    - [ ] 15
    - [ ] 0
    - [ ] Nothing
    - [ ] 1 2 3 4 5
