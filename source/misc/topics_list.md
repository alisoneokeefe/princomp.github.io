## General Concepts

_Students should understand the meaning and importance of the following notions. This statement should be read as "understand the first sentence or paragraph on a wikipedia article", taking [high-level programming language](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/High-level_programming_language) as an example._

- Programming languages types and paradigms
    - Machine language instructions
    - Assembly instructions
    - High-Level Programming Languages
    - Object-oriented paradigm and  data hiding
- The difference between roles (user, tester, programmer)
- How complex piece of software _reuse_ previous pieces.
- The importance of security 🛡
    - Types of attack (malware, phishing, social engineering, zero-day) 
    - Types of loss (loss of integrity / availability / confidentiality)

## Writing and Compiling Programs

- Understand what the "flow of development" is:
    - Having a goal
    - Writing down specifications
    - Creating the source code
    - Running the compiler
    - Reading the compiler's output, warning and error messages
    - Looking for documentation and help on-line and off-line
    - Testing
    - Making sure the program is secure 🛡
    - Editing
    - Reusing
- Using an IDE to
    - Create a project, 
    - Perform some of the steps of the "flow of development",
    - Correctly save and re-open projects,
    - Understand basic features of break points and debugging. ❓

_The IDE used can be [MonoDevelop](https://www.monodevelop.com/) or [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), the student can pick other IDEs if they wish but they will not be supported._

## The Structure of a Program

### First Program -  Hello World

_The students should understand all the components of a simple "Hello World" program:_

- Comments (in line and block)
- `using` statements and namespace / API concepts
- blank lines and spacing
- indentation
- intro to classes and methods' structures (body / header)
- status of `Main` method 
- intro to Console's `Write` and `WriteLine`
- string literal

### Rules and Conventions

- The difference between a "rule" (e.g. case-sensitivity) and a "convention" (commenting your code).
- Reserved words
- Identifiers and naming conventions
- That the distinction can vary with the programming language
- Importance and role of `{` and `}`


# Datatypes and Operators

## Variable

- Datatype (numerical, boolean, string, character) -- including a mention of reference datatypes
- Declaration, assignment, initialization
- Naming variables correctly
- The absence of default value after declaration (un-assigned variables)

## Numerical Values

- Integers (`int`, `long`) – range and size, signature (`uint`)
- Floating Point (`float`, `double`, and `decimal`)  – range, size and precision, 
- Type casting (e.g. from `int` to `double`, and legal operations between different datatypes) and casting operator (e.g. `(int)`).
- Overflow and underflow 🛡

## Booleans

- Possible values (`true`, `false`)
- Usage
- That boolean variables are called "switches"

## Operators

- Binary arithmetic operators: `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`
- Unary arithmetic operators: `++`, `--`
- The difference between postfix and infix notation for unary operators ❓
- Comparison operators: `!=`, `==`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
- Boolean logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
- Precedence and "validity" of some expressions (typically, `! 2 < 3` is not a valid expression) 
- Combined assignment operators: `+=`, `*=`, `-=`, `/=`, `%=`

## Strings

- `ReadLine` method
- Concatenation (`+`)
- Interpolation
- Additional methods: `ToLower`, `ToUpper`, `Contains`, `StartsWith`, `EndsWith` ❓

### Displaying Strings on the Screen

- [Format specifiers]( https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings) for numbers:
    – Currency (`C`), 
    - Fixed-point (`F`) or Number (`N`)
    - Percent (`P`) ❓
    - Exponential (`E`) ❓

- The `String.Format` method ❓

## Characters

- Possible values and the existence of binary, oct, dec and hex representation (cf. for instance [wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ASCII#Printable_characters))
- Escape character and sequences: `\n`, `\t`, `\\`
- Conversion between glyph and decimal value.
- Various methods: `ToLower`, `ToUpper` ❓ 

# Lists ❓

- Creating a list of numbers or strings
- Adding items using the `Add` method
- Accessing items using `[]`
- Removing and Inserting (`Remove`, `RemoveAt`, `Insert`)
- `Count` property

# Basic Control Structures

## Selection Statements

For each of the following structure:

- `if`
- `if-else`
- `if-else if`
- nested `if`s
- `switch`

The student should understand 

- Their importance,
- Their usage,
- Their syntax,
- Their flow,
- When to use one or the other,
- The common pitfalls (e.g., writing a condition in a `switch`).

## Repetition Statements

For each of the following structure:

- `foreach` 
- `while`
- `for`
- `do{…}while(…)` ❓

The student should understand:

- Their importance,
- Their usage,
- Their syntax,
- Their flow,
- When to use one or the other,
- The common pitfalls (e.g. `=` instead of `==`, `<= n` vs `< n`)

As well as being capable of identifying the difference between

- Counter-controlled, 
- Sentinel-controlled, 
- User-controlled

and defining the term "accumulator"

# Object-oriented programming

## Class Conception

- Need and interest of specification 🛡
- UML Class diagram: interest, usage, and simple case (single class with attributes, methods and constructor).
- Access modifier (private, public)
- Principle of least privilege (private variables and methods where possible) 🛡

## Class Implementation

- Attributes (and their default value, as well as how to change them)
- Get and Set methods
- Properties ❓
- Method signature
- Overloading
- [Variable shadowing](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Variable_shadowing) ❓
- Constructors: default constructor and "custom" constructor

## Class Usage

- The `new` keyword
- Object creation using default and custom constructors
- Object manipulation: calling a method, setting an attribute, calling the `ToString` method implicitly.

## Additional Considerations

- `ToString` method
- static class and methods
- [`Math` Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.math) (`Abs`, `Sqrt`, `Pow`) ❓

# Random Class

- Creating a generator with `new Random()`
- Generating non-negative integers,
- Generating integers between ranges,
- Generating double,
- Generating a random word ❓
- Potential problems with deterministic generators 🛡

# Testing and Debugging

- How to test intelligently
- How to test every instruction
- How to test boundary conditions

# Interacting with Users

- Input validation  🛡
- `TryParse` in the `int` and `decimal` classes.
- Reading a single character from the user ❓

# Data structures

## Constant

- The `const` keyword
- Example usages (Avogadro constant, miles-to-kilometer ratio, speed of light) and use case.
- `Math.PI` ❓
- Static constant ❓

## Enumerated Datatype ❓

- Define enumerated datatypes using `enum`
- Enum values (i.e. numerical values assigned to enumerated values by default) ❓
- Use enumerated datatypes (variable declaration, assignment, displaying).

## Arrays

Only one-dimensional arrays should be discussed.

- Vocabulary: index (starting at 0), bounds.
- `Length` property
- `Resize` method ❓
- Different syntaxes for initializing and declaring arrays ❓
- Buffer overflow 🛡

# Exceptions 🔜

- `try…catch` blocks
- Types of exceptions

# File I/O 🔜

- `StreamWriter` and `StreamReader` classes
- Manipulating binary and text files
- `File` class ❓
