## Part II -- Problems

The following three exercises **do not** require a computer. 
Make sure you feel ready before starting them, try to do them with limited time and without notes, and, if you want, check your answer using your IDE.

#. 
    This problem restates the content of the [Order of Operations](https://princomp.github.io/book.html#order-of-operations) section of the lecture notes and ask you to answer various problems.

    There are 5 different arithmetic operations available in C#:

    --------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------------------- ----------------------
            **Operation**         **Arithmetic Operator**         **Algebraic Expression**            **Expression**
            Addition                      `+`                           $x + 7$                     `myVar + 7`
            Subtraction                  `-`                           $x - 7$                     `myVar - 7`
            Multiplication                `*`                         $x \times 7$                  `myVar * 7`
            Division                      `/`                      $x / 7$, or $x \div 7$           `myVar / 7`
    Remainder (a.k.a. modulo)             `%`                         $x \bmod 7$                   `myVar % 7`
    --------------------------- ------------------------- -------------------------------------- ----------------------


    Computing operations involving one of them is straightforward:

    --------------------------------- ---------------
                **Operation**             **Result**
                `3 + 4`                    `7`
                `3 - 4`                    `-1`
                `3 * 4`                    `12`
                `6 / 2`                    `3`
                `6 % 4`                    `2`  
    --------------------------------- ---------------


    But things can get complicated when multiple operators are used, but no parenthesis are indicated. For instance, should

    ```
    7 / 2 - 4 * 8 % 3
    ```

    be read as
    
    ||
    --- | ---
    $(7 \div 2) - ((4 \times 8) \bmod 3)$ | $= 3.5 - (32 \bmod 3)$
    || $= 3.5 - 2$
    || $= 1.5$
 
    or as
    
    ||
    --- | --- 
    $(7 \div (2 - 4)) \times (8 \bmod 3)$ | $= (7 \div (-2)) \times 2$
    || $= (-3.5) \times 2$
    || $= -7$

    Certainly, the result is not the same and there are other possibile ways this calculation may be performed!

    Actually, C# uses the following three rules:
    
    #.  `*`, `/`, and `%`, called the "multiplicative operations," are always evaluated before `+` and `-`, called the "additive operations." So that, for instance,

        ```
        2 - 4 * 8
        ```

        will be evaluated as $2 - (4 * 8) = -30$.

    #.  If there are multiple operations of the same type, they are evaluated from left to right. For instance,

        ```
        4 / 2 * 8
        ```

        will be evaluated as $(4 \div 2) \times 8 = 16$ and

        ```
        4 - 2 + 8
        ```

        will be evaluated as $(4 - 2) + 8 = 10$.

    #.  Parenthesis can be used to force a particular order of evaluation, so that `2 * (3 + 4)` will be evaluated as $2 \times (3 + 4) = 2 \times 7 = 14$, not as $(2 \times 3) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10$ as it would without the parenthesis.

    Answer the following:

    #.  Which of the following operation(s) compute the arithmetic expression $(x \times (3 \bmod 5)) - (y \times 7)$?

        #.  `x * 3 % 5 - y * 7`
        #.  `x * (3 % 5) - y * 7`
        #.  `(x * 3) % 5 - y * 7`
        #.  `x * 3 % (5 - y * 7)`
        #.  `(x * 3 % 5) - (y * 7)`
        #.  `(x * ((3 % 5) - (y * 7))`

    #.  State the order of evaluation of the operators in each of the following operations, and compute the resulting value:

        #.  `8 - 39 * 1 / 12 + 5`
        #.  `12 + -23 / 12 % 3`
        #.  `90 * 23 / 34 - 12 - 13`
        #.  `12 % 83 - 2 * 3`

    #.  (Optional) Check your answers using your IDE.
        You can use a statement of the form:

        ```
        Console.WriteLine($"8 - 39 * 1 / 12 + 5 is {8 - 39 * 1 / 12 + 5}");
        ```
        


#. 
    Write down, on a piece of paper, a fully compilable program that initializes an `int` variable named `persons` with the value 5, an `int` variable named `bottles` with the value 3, and a `double` variable named `literPerBottle` with the value 1.5.
    What should be the type of the `literPerPerson` variable to be able to be assigned the number of liters every person is going to get, if split equitably? 
    Write the correct initialization of that variable and a statement that displays its value.

    Place a delimited comment with a your name and the time at which you wrote the program at the top of the program.
    


#. 
    Write down, on a piece of paper, a program that:

    #.  Declares a `string` variable named `userName`.
    #.  Displays on the screen "Please enter your name, followed by enter:".
    #.  Reads a `string` value from the keyboard and assigns the value to the `userName` variable.
    #.  Declares an `int` variable named `number`.
    #.  Displays on the screen "Please enter your number:".
    #.  Reads an `int` value from the keyboard and assigns the value to the `number` variable.
    #.  Declares a `string` variable named `id` and initializes it with the string referenced by the `userName` variable, followed by the number entered by the user (you can concatenate a string and an int using the + sign).
    #.  Displays on the screen, "Your id is" and the content of the `id` variable.

    Here is an example of execution, where the user input is underlined, and hitting "enter" is represented by ↵:

    ```{text}
    Please enter your name, followed by enter.
    J͟a͟y͟l͟a͟h͟↵͟
    Please enter your area code, followed by enter.
    4͟9͟3͟9͟1͟↵͟
    Your id is Jaylah49391
    Press any key to continue . . .
    ```

## Part II -- Problems

There is only one problem this time, and it is harder than what you'll be asked to do during the exam. Being able to solve it is an excellent sign that you are ready.

#. You are going to design a class named `Triangle`. A triangle has three angles, but knowing the value of only two angles is sufficient to determine the value of the third, since they always add up to  180°. Hence, it is sufficient to have only two `double` attributes, `angle1` and `angle2`. We want to define several methods:

    -   a no-arg constructor that sets the value of `angle1` to $60.0$ and  the value of `angle2` to $60.0$,
    -   another constructor, that takes two arguments, and assigns to  `angle1` the value of the first argument, and assigns to `angle2` the value of the second argument,
    -   getters for `angle1` and `angle2`,
    -   a method that computes and returns the value of the third angle, that we name `ComputeAngle3`,
    -   a method that rotate the triangle: the value of the first angle should be replaced with the value of the second angle, and the value of the second angle should be replaced with the value of the third angle.

    #.  Write the UML diagram for the `Triangle` class.
    #.   Write the full, compilable implementation of the `Triangle` class.

#. What would be displayed on the screen by the following code?

    ```
    if (false)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello!");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("Hi!");
    ```

#. Is there a simpler way to write the expression `over21 == true`, assuming that `over21` is a Boolean variable?
    
#. Assume that `x` and `y` are two `int` variables that have already been initialized (i.e., declared and assigned), write an `if` statement that assigns $10$ to `x` if `y` is (strictly) greater than $5$.

#. In C#, is there a difference between `=` and `==`? Write a statement that uses `=`.

#. Assuming a `name` string was declared and initialized with a value given by the user, write an `if` statement that displays "I have the same name!" if `name` contains your first name.

#. Is the following statement correct, i.e., would it compile, assuming `myFlag` is a `bool` variable, and `myAge` is an initialized `int` variable?

    ```
    if ( myAge > 20 )
    {
        myFlag = true
    };
    ```

#. If we write a statement that begins with `if(false)`, then the IDE returns a warning, "Unreachable code detected". What does it mean? 

#. Write an `if` statement that prints "Bonjour !" if the value of the `char` variable `lang` is `'f'`.

#. For each of the following boolean expressions, decide if it will evaluate to `true` or `false` when the boolean variables `x`, `y` and `z` are all set to `true`:

    -   `x ||  y && z`
    -   `!x ||  y && z`
    -   `!(x ||  y) && (z && y)`
    -   `(!x && x) ||  (!x ||  x)`

    Do the same when they are all set to `false`.

#. Write a `boolean` expression that evaluates to `true` if a variable `x` is between 3 (excluded) and 5 (included).

#. Write an `if-else` statement that assigns $0.1$ to `z` if `y` is greater or equal than $0$, and that assigns $-0.1$ to `z` otherwise.

#. Write an `if-else` statement that assigns `"Minor"` to an already declared `string` variable `legalStatus` if `age` is strictly less than 18, and that assigns `"Major"` to `legalStatus` otherwise.
    
#. Write an `if-else` statement that displays "It's free for you!" if an `int` variable `age` is between 0 and 18, and "It's \$5.00." otherwise.

#. Assume we initialized an `int` variable called `courseNumber` and a `string` variable called `courseCode`. Write a series of statements that will display:
    #. "I'm taking this class!" if `courseNumber` is `1301` and `courseCode` is `CSCI`; 
    #. "That's my major!" if `courseCode` is `CSCI`; 
    #. "Is that an elective?" if `courseNumber` is greater than 3000; or
    #. "Is it a good class?" otherwise.
    
    Your program should display exactly one message.

#. Assume we previously initialized an `int` variable called `graduationYear` and a `string` variable called `graduationSemester`. Write a series of statements that will display:
    #. "I will graduate at the same time!" if `graduationYear` is `2023` and `graduationSemester` is `Fall`; 
    #. "I love this season." if `graduationSemester` is `Spring`; 
    #. "That is in a long time!" if `graduationYear` is greater than 2025; or 
    #. "I hope you'll have an in-person ceremony!" otherwise.
    
    Your program should display exactly one message.

#. Assume we previously initialized a `char` variable called `myChar`. Write a series of statements that will display if the character is…
    #. Uppercase
    #. Lowercase
    #. A number
    #. or none of those.
        
    Your program should display exactly one message.
    Bonus: Make your message also display the ASCII value of the character.
        
#. What will be displayed on the screen by the following program?

    ```
    int x = 3, y = 2, z = 4;

    if (x >= z) {z += y;} else if (x != y) {z *= y;}
    y -= 4;
    Console.WriteLine($"x is {x}, y is {y}, and z is {z}.");
    ```


#. (*We'll use the 24-hour clock, sometimes called "military time".*) Assuming that an `int` variable `hour` has been initialized, write part of a program that would display on the screen "Good morning" if `hours` is less than or equal to 12, and "Hello" otherwise. 

#. Assuming that `myString` is a string variable, write a statement that prints "Hello, Melody!" if the value of `myString` is equal to `Melody`, and nothing otherwise.

#. What will be displayed on the screen by the following program?

    ```

    ```
    if (myLang == 'f')
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Vous parlez Français ?");
    }
    else if (myLang == 'e')
    {

    }
    else if (myLang == 'd')
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Sprechen Sie Deutsch?");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("I do not know your language!");
    }
    ```
        
    ```
    if (myCity == "Augusta")
    {
        Console.WriteLine("I also live here!");
    }
    else if (myCity == "Ithaca" || myCity == "Providence")
    {
        Console.WriteLine("I used to live there!");
        }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("I never lived there.");
    }
    ```

    ```
    if (temp == 100.0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("It's ready!");
    }
    else if (temp >= 90.0)

        Console.WriteLine("Almost ready!");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("You have to wait.");
    }
    ```

    If you think it is not possible or not feasible, explain why.


#. Give an example of an `if` statement that could not be rewritten as a `switch`.

## Part II -- Problems

This time, the two exercises **do not** require a computer, and are here to craft on your problem-solving skills. Make sure you feel ready before starting them, try to do them with a limited amount of time and without notes, and check your answer using your IDE.

#. Write a program that asks the user to write a country name and stores the user's input into a string variable. Then, compare that string with `"france"`: if it is equal, then display at the screen  `"Bienvenue en France !"`. Then, compare that string with `"usa"`: if it is equal, then display at the screen  `"Welcome to the US!"`. If the string is different from both `"france"` and `"usa"`, then display at the screen  `"Welcome to"` followed by the name of the country the user typed in. Can you think of two ways to implement this program, one using `if-else-if` statements, the other using `switch`?


#. You want to write a small program for an on-line printing company. Your program should ask the user to chose a format ($10 \times 15$ centimeters, or $8 \times 11$ inches), ask if it is the first time the customer order through your company, and a number of copies. Then, calculate the total cost of printing those pictures, knowing that

    -   Printing a $10 \times 15$ centimeters picture costs $\$0.20$, printing a $8 \times 11$ inches picture costs $\$0.25$,
    -   A new customer gets a $\$3$ coupon if the order is more than $\$5$, 
    -   A $10\%$ discount is given if more than $50$ copies were ordered,
    -   The two previous offers can be cumulated.

    Display on the screen a message starting by "Welcome!", then a new line, then "We cherish our new customers" if it is the first time the user uses your company, ", so we're giving you a \$3 discount!" if the user is allowed to get the coupon, then print the total and "You had a $10\%$ discount!" if the user ordered more than $50$ copies. See below for examples of execution, where the user input is underlined, and hitting carriage return is represented by ↵.

    ``` text
    Enter 'c' for 10x15cm, anything else for 8x11in.
    c͟ ↵
    Is this your first time here? Type 'y' for 'yes'.
    y͟ ↵
    Enter a number of copies.
    9͟0͟ ↵
    Welcome!
    We cherish our new customers, so we are giving you a $3 discount!
    Your total is $13.50. You had a 10% discount!
    ```

    ``` text
    Enter 'c' for 10x15cm, anything else for 8x11in.
    p͟ ↵
    Is this your first time here? Type 'y' for 'yes'.
    N͟o͟t͟ ͟a͟t͟ ͟a͟l͟l͟↵
    Enter a number of copies.
    1͟2͟0͟ ↵
    Your total is $27.00. You had a 10% discount!
    ```

#. What is input validation? Name a control structure that can be used to perform it. Why is it important?

#. What do we name a variable that is increased by some value at every iteration of a loop, i.e., that keeps the running total?

#. What is a sentinel value?

#. Write a program that asks the user to enter a value between $0$ and $10$, and asks again as long as the user enters integers outside that range.

    - "Unknown" otherwise.

#. Write a program that asks the user to enter a value between 1900 and 1999 (both included), and asks again as long as the user enters integers outside that range.

## Part II -- Problems

#. Write a `switch` statement that calculates the number of days in a particular month. You should assume that you are given already assigned `month` and `year` `int` variables, and that your program should set an already declared `int` `numberOfDays` variable to 28, 29, 30 or 31 depending on the month / year combination. Your program should start with a `switch` matching `month` against certain values, and, if `month` is 2, uses an `if` statement to decide whenever the number of days is 28 or 29. You can use something like

    ```
    switch (month) {
        …
        case (2):
            if …
            …
            break;
        …
    }
    ```
