 * This is a possible solution, many other answers were valid.
 * It uses by default the following way of computing the grade:
         Evaluation  Number   Points   Percents
  ---------------- -------- -------- ----------
           Quizzes    4        20       10%
          Projects    2        20       10%
    In-class Tests    2       100       40%
        Final Exam    1       200       40%
        
 * But can be relatively easily tweaked to accomodate other grade calculations.
 *
 * WARNING: The calculation on D2L will be used to compute your final grade.
 * This program is for informative purpose only.
