#  First Arrays Manipulations

This lab serves multiple goals:

- To introduce you to arrays of different datatypes,
- To introduce you to the different ways of declaring, assigning and initializing arrays,
- To iterate over arrays,
- To use the `Length` property of array,

## Declaration, Assignment & Initialization of an Array

### Warm-up

Write a program that implements the following steps:

#. declares an array `myArray` of `int` of size $5$,
#. initializes `myArray` with the values $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$,
#. displays the content of `myArray` on the screen.

Questions
~ 
    - What values are stored in this array after declaring it _but before initializing it_?
    - There are a few different ways you can declare and initialize an array of size $5$ holding values $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$ and $5$. Can you think of two different ways of doing this?
    
<details><summary>Answer:</summary>
- All the values in the array are set to 0,
- Two possible ways are `int[] myArray = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};` and `int[] myArray =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`.
</detail>

### Going wrong

Now, let us write *incorrect* statements.
For each of the programs below, compile them and make sure you understand the error messages that are displayed.

#### Trying to set all the values at once after declaring

```
int[] myArrayA = new int[5];
myArrayA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```
#### Out of bound error (read)

```
int[] myArrayB = new int[5];
Console.WriteLine(myArrayB[5]);
```

#### Out of bound error (write)

```
int[] myArrayC = new int[5];
myArrayC[5] = 12;
```

#### Reading the array as a whole (technically not an error)

```
int[] myArrayD = new int[5];
Console.WriteLine(myArrayD);
```

This last statement is not "incorrect" in the sense that it will not prevent your program from executing, but it is not doing what you could or would have expected.

## Second Array Manipulation

Write a program that

#. declares an array `myArray` of `int` of size $10$,
#. initializes `myArray` with the values $1$, $2$, $3$, â€¦, $9$ and $10$,
#. displays the content of `myArray`.
#. sums the values stored in `myArray` and displays the result.
#. computes the product of the values stored in `myArray` and displays the result.


If you are unsure how to get started, you can use the following code.

<details><summary>Getting started:</summary>
```
int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int i = 0;
int sum = 0;
int product = 1;
while(i < myArray.Length){
    // Fill this!
    i++;
}
Console.WriteLine("The sum of the values in the array is " + sum + ".");

Console.WriteLine("The product of the values in the array is " + product + ".");
```
</details>

## Exploring Arrays

For this part, create a new array:

#. declare a `char` array of length $6$, name it `letters`
#. initialize the first 4 indices of `letters` with the following values: `'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'`
#. initialize *index 5* of `letters` with the value `'f'`

Now, write the following statements:

#. Write a statement to display the last `char` value in `letters` (should display `f`).
#. Write a statement to display the value stored at index 4. What is that value? Why?
#. Write a statement to display the characters in the _first half_ of the array (`'a', 'b', 'c'` but no others).

Execute your program to ensure you are seeing the expected output before proceeding.

Next, update the part of the program where `letters` is declared and change the length of `letters` to $8$. Do not modify any other parts of the program. Then execute the program again.

Answer the following questions:

#. What is the last `char` of the `letters` array now, after changing its length?
#. Does your program still output _the last_ `char` value in `letters` array?
#. When displaying the first half of the array, does your program still display _the first half_? (After changing the length, the first half contains the values `'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'`)
#. If you did not get the last value or the first half you expected, can you think of a way to perform these array operations in a way that can accommodate arrays of different lengths?
