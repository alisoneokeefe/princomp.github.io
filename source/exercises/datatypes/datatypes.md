## Warm-up Exercises

#. Explain Boolean type bool and the meaning of logical operations AND (&&), OR (||) and negation (!). Provide a small example.
<details>
	<summary>Solution</summary>
		The boolean data type holds either of the two values true or false. The AND and OR operators are used to evaluate multiple conditions. The AND returns true if all conditions are true, and the OR operator returns true if at least one of them is true. The negation operator changes a boolean value into its opposite.
	  
Example:

```cs
	bool b1 = true, b2 = false;
	
	Console.Write(b1 && !b2); // outputs true
	Console.Write(b1 || b2); // outputs true
```
