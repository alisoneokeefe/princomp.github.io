# Arrays of Objects

An array can contain more than simple datatypes: it can contains object.
It can be objects from a custom class, or even â€¦ arrays, which are themselves objects!

## Array of Objects From a Custom Class

In the following example, we will ask the user how many `Item` objects (the details of the implementation does not matter, but can be [inspired by this example](./lectures/flow/control_flow_and_classes#setters-with-input-validation)) they want to create, then fill an array with `Item` objects initialized from user input:

```
Console.WriteLine("How many items would you like to stock?");
Item[] items = new Item[int.Parse(Console.ReadLine())];
int i = 0;
while(i < items.Length)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Enter description of item {i+1}:");
    string description = Console.ReadLine();
    Console.WriteLine($"Enter price of item {i+1}:");
    decimal price = decimal.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    items[i] = new Item(description, price);
    i++;
}
```

Observe that, since we do not perform any user-input validation, we can simply use the result of `int.Parse()` as the size declarator for the `items` array - no `size` variable is needed at all.

We can also use `while` loops to search through arrays for a particular value. For example, this code will find and display the lowest-priced item in the array `items`, which was initialized by user input:

```
Item lowestItem = items[0];
int i = 1;
while(i < items.Length)
{
    if(items[i].GetPrice() < lowestItem.GetPrice())
    {
        lowestItem = items[i];
    }
    i++;
}
Console.WriteLine($"The lowest-priced item is {lowestItem}");
```

Note that the `lowestItem` variable needs to be initialized to refer to an `Item` object before we can call the `GetPrice()` method on it; we cannot call `GetPrice()` if `lowestItem` is `null`. We could try to create an `Item` object with the "highest possible" price, but a simpler approach is to initialize `lowestItem` with `items[0]`. As long as the array has at  least one element, `0` is a valid index, and the first item in the array can be our first "guess" at the lowest-priced item.
