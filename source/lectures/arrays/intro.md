# Arrays

Arrays are structures that allow you to store multiple values in memory using a single name and indexes.

- Usually all the elements of an array have the same type.
- You limit the type of array elements when you declare the array.
- If you want the array to store elements of any type, you can specify `object` as its type.

An array can be:

- Single-Dimensional,
- Multidimensional,
- Jagged.

Arrays are useful, for instance,

- When you want to store a collection of related values,
- When you do not know in advance how many variables will be needed,
- When you need a large number of variables (say, 10) of the same type.
