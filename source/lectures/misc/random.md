# Random

- Random Number Generation

	- Produce a number within some bounds following some statistical rules.
	- A true random number is a number that is **nondeterministically** selected from a set of numbers wherein each possible selection has an equal probability of occurrence.
	- Usually in computer science we contend with **pseudo-random** numbers.  These are not truly nondeterministic, but an approximation of random selection based on some algorithm.
	- Since pseudo-random selections are "determined" by an algorithm, or set of rules, they are technically **deterministic**.
	
	
- Random Class in C#

	- Instantiate a random number generator and use to select numbers:
	
		```
		Random rand = new Random();
		Random randB = new Random(seed_int);
		```
		
	- Notice that we can create a generator with or without an argument.  The argument is called a **seed** for the generator.
	- A seed tells the generator where to start its sequence.  Using the same seed will always reproduce the same sequence of numbers.
	- The default constructor still has a seed value, but it is a hidden value pulled from the clock time during instantiation.
	- Time-based seeds only reset approximately every 15 milliseconds.
	- The random class is not "random enough" for cryptography.
	- For cryptographic randomness, use the [RNGCryptoServiceProvider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.rngcryptoserviceprovider?view=net-5.0) class or [System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.randomnumbergenerator?view=net-5.0).


- Using Random

	- Next() method returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 2,147,483,647 (max signed `int`), inclusive.
	- By default, the number is always non-negative and within that range.
	
		```
		int randomInt = rand.Next();
		```
		
	- What if we wanted to create a random number between 0 and 100?
	- We could use rand.Next() and then use modulo to cut down the answer range!
	- Alternatively, we could give the Next() method an `int` argument to set a ceiling.
	
		```
		int randomUpto100 = rand.Next(101);
		```
		
	- The ceiling value is **exclusive**, so remember to use one number higher than what you want to be your max number.
	- We can also pass two arguments in order to set a range for the values.
	
		```
		int random50to100 = rand.Next(50,101);
		```
		
	- The ceiling value is still exclusive, but the floor is **inclusive**.
	- NextDouble() returns a **normalized** value (value between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive).
	- What if we want a different range?  Adjust with math!
	
		```
		double randNeg2to3 - (rand.NextDouble()*5)-2;
		```
		
	- NextBytes() method takes a `byte` array as an argument and generates a random `byte` value for each index.
	- Remember, a `byte` has an unsigned value between 0 and 255 inclusive.
	
		```
		byte[] byteArray = new byte[10];
		rand.NextBytes(byteArray);
		```
		
	
- Creating Random Strings

	- What if we want to construct random strings made of a, b, c, and d?
	- Other techniques are available, but we can use a loop and switch!
	
		```
		Random rand = new Random();
		string answer = “”;
		int selection = 0;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
		{
			selection = rand.Next(4);
			switch(selection){
			case(0):
				answer+=“a”;
				break;
			case(1):
				answer+=“b”;
				break;
			case(2):
				answer+=“c”;
				break;
			default:
				answer+=“d”;
				break;
			}
		}
		```
