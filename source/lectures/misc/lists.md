# The List collections

## Introduction

The `List` class serves a similar purpose than arrays, but with a few notable differences:

- Lists do not need to have a number of elements fixed ahead of time,
- Lists automatically expand when elements are added,
- Lists automatically shrink when elements are removed,
- Lists require to have the `using System.Collections.Generic;` statement at the beginning of the file.
