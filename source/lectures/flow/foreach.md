#  The foreach Loop

- When writing a `for` loop that accesses each element of an array once, you will end up writing code like this:

    ```
    for(int i = 0; i < myArray.Length; i++)
    {
        <do something with myArray[i]>;
    }
    ```

- In some cases, this code has unnecessary repetition: If you are not using the counter `i` for anything other than an array index, you still need to declare it, increment it, and write the condition with `myArray.Length`

- The **foreach loop** is a shortcut that allows you to get rid of the counter variable and the loop condition. It has this syntax:

    ```
    foreach(<type> <variableName> in <arrayName>)
    {
        <do something with variable>
    }
    ```

    - The loop will repeat exactly as many times as there are elements in the array
    - On each iteration of the loop, the variable will be assigned the next value from the array, in order
    - The variable must be the same type as the array

- For example, this loop accesses each element of `homeworkGrades` and computes their sum:

    ```
    int sum = 0;
    foreach(int grade in homeworkGrades)
    {
        sum += grade;
    }
    ```

    - The variable `grade` is declared with type `int` since `homeworkGrades` is an array of `int`
    - `grade` has a scope limited to the body of the loop, just like the counter variable `i`
    - In successive iterations of the loop `grade` will have the value `homeworkGrades[0]`, then `homeworkGrades[1]`, and so on, through `homeworkGrades[homeworkGrades.Length - 1]`

- A `foreach` loop is **read-only** with respect to the array: The loop's variable cannot be used to *change* any elements of the array. This code will result in an error:

    ```
    foreach(int grade in homeworkGrades)
    {
        grade = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
    }
    ```
