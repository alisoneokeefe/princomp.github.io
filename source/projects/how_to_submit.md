title: How to Submit Projects
---

# Submission

Once your project is done, zip the folder into a file "lname_fname",
where "lname" is your last name and "fname" is your first name. With the file
extension, the filename will look like "lname_fname.zip. Upload
this zip onto D2L before the deadline in the appropriate assignment submission folder.

Make sure your file is named "lname_fname.zip" and not "lname_fname.zip.zip". 
Some operating systems hide the file's extension by default, but you may be 
able to see it by right-clicking on it and then selecting "Properties" or "Get Info".

*Make sure you submitted the correct files*, for instance by retracing the steps described in [the Hello World lab](./labs/HelloWorld#how-was-the-backup)

# Additional Considerations

## Criteria for Success

A good, finished project should include *all* of the following:

-   Something was submitted on D2L.
-   The archive can be downloaded and extracted, and the solution in it can
    be opened using any IDE.
-   The archive and solution have the correct names.
-   Your name and the date are in a delimited comment at the beginning
    of the file.
-   The program compiles and can be executed.
-   All the variables have appropriate types and are set to the correct
    value.
-   The conversion is correctly performed.
-   The message is correctly displayed.
-   Your code is commented.

## Advice and Recommendations

-   Read the problem statement over and over; make sure you did not
    overlook anything.
-   Make sure your project compiles without errors or warnings and can
    be executed as expected.
-   Test your code again and again, and compare your result with our examples.
-   A partially completed project is better than nothing. Do not
    hesitate to add a comment describing your difficulties; that will
    show that you are aware of the limitations of your program.
-   Make sure you submitted the correct files by re-downloading them
    (possibly on a different computer) and making sure you can still
    compile and execute your program.
-   *Do not* ask other classmates for help. This work is supposed to be
    *your own*, and should reflect *your own* understanding of the
    previous labs. Copying and pasting code from the internet will hurt
    your grade and your understanding of this class. Any cheating will
    be easily detected and punished according to the documents mentioned
    in the syllabus.
-   You can ask the instructor or the (under)graduate course assistants for help
    and feedback. Please upload your project according to the
    instructions and send an email asking to go over it if you want us
    to check that you submitted the correct file, that your code compiles,
    etc. You should ask early and not wait until the last minute.
    Asking during lab is fine.
